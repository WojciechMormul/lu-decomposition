# LU decomposition

Solve system of linear equations Ax=b with LU decomposition, which factors matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. Considered system of linear equations then becomes: LUx=b. First solve Ly=b with forward substitution, then solve Ux=y with backward substitution.
