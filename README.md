# LU decomposition

Solve system of linear equations Ax=b with LU decomposition, which factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. Considered system of linear equations becomes: LUx=b. First solve Ly=b with forward substitution. Then solve Ux=y with backward substitution.
